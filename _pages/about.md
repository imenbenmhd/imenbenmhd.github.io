Hi person who is passing by ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m **Imen Ben Mahmoud**, an R&D Engineer in Artificial Intelligence at the Idiap Research Institute in Martigny, Switzerland. With a background in physics and two Masterâ€™s degrees, one in Applied Physics from EPFL and another in AI from UniDistance Switzerland, I design and deploy machine-learning models for bioacoustics and speech processing. My recent work includes applying self-supervised learning to animal vocalization classification and developing signal-processing pipelines in Python robust feature extraction. Outside of research, I help organize the [Premices Festival](https://premices.ch/) and love experimenting with international cooking recipes in my free time.
